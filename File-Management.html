        <h1>File Management Techniques</h1>

        <p class="first-paragraph">
          Everything on your hard drive is made of files and folders. Files
          store data, and folders store files (as well as other folders).
          Moving, deleting, and copying files, are three essential operating
          systems. You might need to copy a file in order to replicate it
          somewhere else, like another tab, or a different presentation site.
          Or maybe you need to make more space on your computer, and you have
          big useless files you’d like to delete. These actions luckily can be
          completed at ease, thanks to shortcuts. Let’s have a look how.

        </p>

        <h2> CopyFile </h2>

        <p class="second-paragraph">
           Copying a file, will allow you to have it in two different places.
           You could have a backup file incase the original gets deleted. All
           you need to do is place it in a different directory. By using the
           shortcut (Ctrl-C) or by right clicking the file and pressing ‘copy’,
           you will copy all of the information on a file, or a folder. If you
           had multiple files within a folder, all files would be saved too. If
           you were to replicate it into the same directory, it would ask you
           to rename the folder, as you cannot have multiple of the same named
           folder, in one directory. It would confuse both you and the hard
           drive when trying to open, copy and paste a file or folder. Now, to
           paste what you have copied, use the shortcut (Ctrl-V), or right click
           an empty space in a directory, and then click ‘paste’.</p>
