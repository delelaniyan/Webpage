# Things I have learnt from this activity

During the process of creating my website on Operating Systems, I learned more about how folders work on file managers. I've always known how to copy and move files luckily, however, I've become more familiar now, with folders, and master folders, and duplicating files into new folders. I didn't even realize you could hae folders within folders. 

# Things I still want to learn

I'd still like to learn how devices are able to move around so much information around so fast, and moreover, how they are able to replicate information that took hours to create in second. It amazes me how easily technology let's us control things, such as files, and file organisers (with shortcuts as well) make things so easy, and it's shocking. Perhaps there is coding behind it? I'm not sure.
